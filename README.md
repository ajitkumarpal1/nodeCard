# CARD_with_Node.js_and_MongoDB
This project is a simple server-side application built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides RESTful APIs for managing user data in a MongoDB database.

Card Project  =>
This is a sample project that demonstrates a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing user data using a Node.js server and MongoDB database. The project provides a RESTful API for performing CRUD operations on user data.

Installation  =>
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow the instructions below:
1.	Clone the repository or download the project files.
2.	Make sure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine.
3.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4.	Install the project dependencies by running the following command:
shellCopy code
npm install 
5.	Set up the MongoDB database:
•	Make sure MongoDB is running on your local machine or update the MongoDB connection string in server.js to point to your MongoDB instance.
•	The default connection string is mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017/newDB.
6.	Start the server by running the following command:
shellCopy code
node server.js 
7.	The server should now be running on http://localhost:8000. You can access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or by making HTTP requests programmatically.

API Endpoints =>
The following API endpoints are available:
•	GET /user - Retrieve all users
•	POST /user/create - Create a new user
•	PUT /user/update/:id - Update an existing user by ID
•	DELETE /user/delete/:id - Delete a user by ID
Please note that :id in the URL represents the unique identifier of the user.

Usage =>
Once the server is running and the endpoints are available, you can interact with the API to manage user data. Here are some examples:
•	To retrieve all users, send a GET request to http://localhost:8000/user.
•	To create a new user, send a POST request to http://localhost:8000/user/create with the user data in the request body.
•	To update a user, send a PUT request to http://localhost:8000/user/update/:id with the user ID in the URL parameter and the updated user data in the request body.
•	To delete a user, send a DELETE request to http://localhost:8000/user/delete/:id with the user ID in the URL parameter.
Make sure to replace :id in the URL with the actual user ID.
